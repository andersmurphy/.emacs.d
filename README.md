>"This, milord, is my family's ~~axe~~ emacs. We have owned it for almost nine hundred years, see. 
Of course, sometimes it needed a new blade. And sometimes it has required a new handle, 
new designs on the metalwork, a little refreshing of the ornamentation . . . 
but is this not the nine hundred-year-old ~~axe~~ emacs of my family? And because it has changed gently over time, 
it is still a pretty good ~~axe~~ emacs, y'know. Pretty good."
