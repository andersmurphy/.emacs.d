>"This, milord, is my family's emacs. We have owned it for almost nine hundred years, see.
Of course, sometimes it needed a new major-mode. And sometimes it has required a new key binding,
new designs on the modeline, a little refreshing of the theme . . .
but is this not the nine hundred-year-old emacs of my family? And because it has changed gently over time,
it is still a pretty good emacs, y'know. Pretty good."
